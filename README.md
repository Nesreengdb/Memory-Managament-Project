# Memory-Managament-Project
 This project will involve managing a contiguous region of memory using a fixed size partition scheme.
Assume the memory is divided into a fixed size of free (available) M partitions (holes/blocks), where the
size of each partition can be unequal. the program should be able to perform three main tasks, which
are: Allocates memory blocks, de-allocates memory blocks, and provides a status report about the current
state of memory. The allocation of memory blocks should be performed using one of the three contiguous
memory allocation approaches [First-fit (F), Best-fit (B), or Worst-fit (W)], depending on the user-entered
selection.
